# Market Sizing Research Task

## Purpose
Perform rigorous market sizing to quantify Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).

## Inputs
- Market or segment to size
- Geographic scope
- Time period
- Product/service category definition

## Process

### 1. Define Market Boundaries
- Clearly define market scope
- Identify included and excluded segments
- Define geographic boundaries
- Specify time period
- Document assumptions

### 2. Top-Down Sizing
- Start with total market size
- Apply relevant filters and constraints
- Segment by geography, demographics, etc.
- Calculate TAM from top-down perspective
- Validate with multiple data sources

### 3. Bottom-Up Sizing
- Identify target customer segments
- Estimate segment sizes
- Calculate average revenue per customer
- Aggregate to total market size
- Validate assumptions with data

### 4. Value Theory Approach
- Estimate value created for customers
- Calculate willingness to pay
- Estimate adoption rates
- Project market size based on value
- Cross-validate with other methods

### 5. Market Segmentation
- Segment market by relevant dimensions
- Size each segment independently
- Identify high-potential segments
- Calculate SAM and SOM
- Prioritize segments by attractiveness

### 6. Growth Projections
- Analyze historical growth rates
- Identify growth drivers
- Project future growth scenarios
- Calculate CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
- Provide confidence intervals

## Outputs
- Market sizing report with TAM/SAM/SOM
- Market segmentation analysis
- Growth projections and scenarios
- Methodology documentation
- Data source validation

## Success Criteria
- Multiple methodologies validate sizing
- Assumptions are clearly documented
- Data sources are credible
- Segmentation is meaningful
- Growth projections are realistic
